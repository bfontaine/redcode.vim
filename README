This syntax file supports the REDCODE '88 or '94 (with or without Pspace extensions) languages as defined in the ICWS'94 Draft (extended).

The language was first popularized in a March 1984 Scientific American article, Core War Guidelines, by A. K. Dewdney and D. G. Jones.

This implementation can be configured to flag elements of Redcode '94 when used in coding Redcode '88 warriors. It also highlights line-continuations (responsible for a well-known problem with the program Marcia Trionfale 1.3).
